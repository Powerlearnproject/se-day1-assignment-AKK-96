Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It is important because it plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming languages
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline
3. he advent of structured programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirementsâ€”Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements means researching what the users want or need before you commit to building.
2. Design - creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
3. Implementation - Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
4. Testing - Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
5. Deployment - Releasing the software to users or customers
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear, structured approach best for projects with fixed requirements, such as government or banking systems. Agile is iterative and flexible, ideal for evolving projects like mobile apps or AI development. Waterfall ensures predictability, while Agile allows for continuous feedback and adaptation.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer - Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project manager - Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's provide tools fro writing, debugging, and testing code e.g Visual Studio and VCS track changes to source code while coordinating team members e.g Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements - by creating a solid start-off plan backed by ample research and communication, this can be avoided.
Tight deadline - by using agile methodologies, prioritizing tasks and creating enough room and time frames to achieve goals this will make it easier not to rush as the main objective is to attain High-Quality software.
Technical debt - by having regular reassessments of project goals and timelines, and not using shortcuts and giving optimal solutions to problems faced during the creation process, this can be also avoided.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing tests individual components or modules of software, Integration testing tests between different components or subsystems, System testing tests the entire software system as a whole, acceptance testing tests the software against user requirements and needs. 
All of this testing helps identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the crafting of questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models, it helps to make the questions clear and specific, so that the AI understands.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt: Hey ChatGPT, how is the weather?
Clear prompt: Hey ChatGPT, kindly give me an hourly report of the weather today in my area for the next 12 hours and give me estimations of the temperature so that I can decide if i should carry a sweater and an umbrella when I go outside.

the second prompt is more concise and specific in terms of location, time and temperature than the first one.
